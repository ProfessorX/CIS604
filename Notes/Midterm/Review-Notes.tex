\begin{itemize}
% \item Life is fucking awesome in the United Arab Emirates!
% \item Life is a bitch. Fuck it or leave it, choose one.
\item An agent is an entity that can perceive and act. This course is
  about designing rational agents. 
\item Rational behavior: doing the right thing. 
\item Environment Types: Fully observable; Deterministic; Episodic;
  Static, Discrete; Single-agent. The counter part: partially
  observable; stochastic; sequential; dynamic; continuous;
  multi-agent. 
\item An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its
  environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through
  actuators.

\begin{itemize}
% \item Life is fucking awesome in the United Arab Emirates!
\item A search problem consists of 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a state space
  \item a successor function (namely \textbf{update function} in data
    mining algorithm series)
  \item a start state (\textbf{initial value}), goal test
    (\textbf{terminating value}) and path cost function (\textbf{we
      say weights in Graph Theory})
  \end{itemize}
