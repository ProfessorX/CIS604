*** Unit Resolution rule
    - (and (or p q) (not q)) ; if we want the result to be true, the
      only way is (p #t)
    - (and (or (l1 l2 l3 ... lk)) m)
    - (A<->B) == (and (A->B) (B->A))
    - (A->B) == (or (not A) B)

*** Resolution
    - Resolution is sound and complete.
       

*** Propositional logic reasoning 
    - resolution rule
    - conjunctive normal form
    - resolution algorithm[fn:1] The logic gate and similar things in
      Digital Circuits will help.
