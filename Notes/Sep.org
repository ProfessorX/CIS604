The good old saying before you came to Masdar, "It's all about
mathematics."


** Beyond classical search

*** Depth-Limited Search
    - alpha-beta pruning
      - Pruning has *no effect* on the final result of search

*** Stochastic 
    - Expectimax search
     
*** TODO Required reading
    - Chapter 5

** Constraint Satisfaction Problems


*** Map coloring
    - Constraint graph
    - Greedy algorithm
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Vertex_coloring][Graph Coloring]] (highly recommended)

*** Varieties of CSPs
    - Discrete
    - Continuous
 
*** Standard Search Formulation
    - initial state
    - successor
    - goal test
    - path test

*** Backtrack search
    -

*** Truth table
    - Wikipedia [fn:1]

*** Reasoning
    - Aspect (real world) --> facts 
    - aspect --> sentences
    - facts --> sentences
    -

*** Reasoning for machine
    - (and S1 S2) --> (Alpha)
    - (and S1 S2) --> (not Alpha) [fn:2]

*** Notations
    - Have: A, A-->B; Reasoning: B. (Another form: (or (not A) B))[fn:3]
    - Knowledge Base = {P, (not (not (and Q R)))} alpha = (and (not
      (not P)) R)
    - Lambda Calculus (there and back again the Artificial
      Intelligence) [fn:4]
