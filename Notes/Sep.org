*** Stochastic 
    - Expectimax search
     
*** TODO Required reading
    - Chapter 5

** Constraint Satisfaction Problems


*** Map coloring
    - Constraint graph
    - Greedy algorithm
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Vertex_coloring][Graph Coloring]] (highly recommended)

*** Varieties of CSPs
    - Discrete
    - Continuous
 
*** Standard Search Formulation
